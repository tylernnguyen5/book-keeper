# HOW IT WORKS

- This is an application for storing your favorite website bookmarks
- It has local storage saving feature, which means you once you save the bookmark(s), you can turn off the browser, come back and all the bookmark(s) will remain
- If the local storage is empty, the application with populate it with 1 object data
- You can also delete unwanted bookmark(s)
- The bookmark contains an website name and an url
- The favicon of the website is populate dynamically
